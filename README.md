##Using the Application
Once you have the application running, you can use it to purchase tickets to a show by following these steps:
Select a show from the list of upcoming shows.
Enter the quantity of tickets you want to purchase.
Enter your basic billing information (name, email, and address).
Review the order summary to see the total cost of your order.
Click the "Checkout" button to complete your purchase (Note: this will not actually process your payment, since this is a mock application).
